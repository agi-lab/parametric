The paper studies the welfare comparison between traditional indemnity insurance (with deductibles) and parametric insurance when agents face realistic pricing frictions, risk loadings, and binding premium budgets. While classical insurance theory establishes the optimality of deductible indemnity contracts under ideal conditions, we show that parametric insurance can dominate in economically relevant settings—especially in high-risk environments where full insurance becomes unaffordable or unavailable.

The analysis combines closed-form theoretical results under a mean–variance objective with numerical illustrations calibrated to low-frequency, high-severity risks such as natural disasters.
